The project objective is to apply scalable data analytics tools and techniques to gain useful insights to analyze and identify the factors that cause airline delays for the year. The project source is Kaggle with complete data for the year 2019, USA. The project activities include ingesting data into Hadoop and using Hive to run queries and extract meaningful information.
Another objective of this project is to develop dashboards using Apache Superset to analyze the data and identify the most important attributes that contribute to the factors that cause delays like the weather conditions. We also aim to find relationships between these factors.
We also aim to train machine learning algorithms on this data set using PySpark and find an algorithm that works best for this classification problem.
